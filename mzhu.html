                <p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
My goal was to review the OpenGL rendering process and start rendering the game war field.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
I reviewed the OpenGL rendering process.
<br><br>
<b>3. If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. So answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</b>
<br><br>
I haven’t started coding for this specific game because I’m still trying to get started with the graphics.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Start rendering the game scene and mock the game character.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I’m doing mostly reviews for this week so I didn’t learn anything new.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
It’s pretty good.

				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
Finish rendering the donut, and nail the rendering pipeline.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
Start designing the state input for rendering.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Fix the rendering pipeline. Because we changed something.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Fix the state input and render something using a hardcoded state.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I did some learning about rendering the fbx file in openGL and I didn’t expect to learn it.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Nice.

<br><br>
Fix the state input and render something using hardcoded state.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
Everything.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Goals are met.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Learn how to make animation in OpenGL, and render the actual game state instead of hardcoded objects.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
<br><br>

<br><br>
Learn how to make animation in the OpenGL, and render the actual game state instead of hardcoded object.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Learning animation.

<br><br>
I didn’t managed to render the whole state because we just fixed the object design, and I had a very busy schedule last week which left me little time for this project. I’ll have more time to focus on the project for the following weeks.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Render the actual game state instead of hardcoded object. Use OpenGL to do basic animation.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
Assimp library.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Nice.

			<h2 class="left-text">Week 6</h2>
			<div class="report-content">
				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
Render the actual game state.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
Rendered the source object and compile the code on my computer and lab machine.
<br><br>

<br><br>
I didn’t manage to render the whole game state because the communication between the client and the graphics was not fixed, so I’m still using hardcoded locations to render the objects. Another issue was that the source objects have different formats, so we need to make them uniform to read the file.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Add textures or colors to the objects and keep trying to add animations.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I gained many practical experiences about compiling and running c++ projects in visual studio and I didn’t expect that to take so long. I also learned more about rendering the obj file in OpenGL.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Very good and I’m excited about our project.
