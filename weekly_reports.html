Every one of us has been working really hard to get familiar with the tools we are going to use throughout our game development -- Blender, OpenGL, Winsock, etc.<br>
At the beginning of this week, we decided as a group our task assignment, and made our initial development plan. After talking to the professor and the TA, we saw some parts of our plan were vague, so we planned to revise our plan during the next group meeting.<br>
Also, we are learning the architecture of our game, that is, how different parts of the game are connected, and how they work as a whole. After understanding the overall architecture, we hope to break it down as much as we can, so that we are able to make a more detailed and comprehensive plan, and each one of us can have a clearer goal in the future weeks.

Every subteam has made some progress during the past week. Our artist Siqi has designed a 3-D map with blocks, and is working closely with the graphics team to start rendering our game objects. The graphics team has developed their graphic engine and successfully rendered the donut with shading normals, and is now working on object textures. The networking team decided to use the Boost library, and implemented an application where data can be transmitted between client and server and cached on the server side, and the server can distinguish different clients.<br>
During the meeting, we talked about the overall gameplay, including design of weapons and abilities, and how players can interact with each other and blocks on the map. We also outlined our overall game architecture, and decided to implement two "loops" to take player keyboard input and update the map status.<br>
For the next week, we will start integrating things by implementing interfaces for cross-team interactions and rendering more models with our graphics engine. We will further develop our gameplay code and work on detailed game logic.
