<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
My goal was to learn some OpenGL knowledge from past CSE167 lectures and assignments, as well as the official documentation of OpenGL.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
Not completely. I’ve downloaded OpenGL and I think that I’ve finished the setup, but there is still a lot I don’t understand about OpenGL. I haven’t understood their hw2 yet.
<br><br>
<b>3. If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. So answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</b>
<br><br>
Xincheng suddenly decided to go back to China last Thursday, and we packed together, which left barely any time for him to teach me OpenGL or for me to learn the materials by myself.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Continue the learning process. Hopefully I could render something with Emily and Xincheng next week.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I’ve learnt how to set up OpenGL, and some basics in OpenGL. I do expect to learn them.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Nice.

			<div class="report-content">
				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
My goal switched from starting rendering to finishing designing client-side file structure, especially keyboard detection and logics.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
Not completely. I’m almost done with it, but still have something needing discussion with server-sides.
<br><br>

<br><br>
I had the switching, so I haven’t started working on this part until these days.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Finish keyboard detection part. Hopefully I could work on some game logic on the server-side.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
The systematic way for file system design.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Nice.

			<h2 class="left-text">Week 4</h2>
			<div class="report-content">
				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
Added some code of data transmission between the server and the client. Designed relevant protocol in the game.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
All the above.
<br><br>
<b>3. If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve.

<br><br>
I finished my goal. But I think I could put more room of flexibility in the code for the sack of potential changes, debugings, and maintainance.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Writing code of the main game logic, like the items’ behaviors.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I learned about the interaction between the server and the client, which I didn’t expect at all. I am glad that I learned something new.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
I feel great. I’m glad that I am more patient and give more respect than I was before, listening to others’ ideas.

			<h2 class="left-text">Week 5</h2>
			<div class="report-content">
				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
Add some main game logic such as items’ behaviors.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
I’ve added a player struct and an object struct used for storing data.<br>
I’ve added a .h file counting objects.<br>
I’ve added the logic to initialize a player.<br>
I’ve checked the boundary when the player wants to move, and check whether the player encounters some weapons and update corresponding struct.
<br><br>

<br><br>
I finished my goal. But I think there is still a lot I could do.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Implement the logic of generating the initial game board; implement the code to communicate with client side for game board and game state rendering.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
During the process of implementing, I feel I’m more familiar with C++. And it’s a great experience converting the abstract ideas down to be concrete codes.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Great!

<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
Implement the logic of generating the initial game board; implement the code to communicate with client side for game board and game state rendering.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
I’ve added the code to initialize the weapon list, and generate a weapon from the list and update it when a destroyable cube encounters a bomb.<br>
I’ve added the code to initialize the game board from a txt input file, including generating non-destroyable cubes from the file and randomly generating destroyable cubes.<br>
I’ve added the code to check the bomb's effect, though not considering time effect yet.
<br><br>

<br><br>
I haven’t finished updating the connection between client and graphic yet. When implementing the first part of the goal, reading from the file, I got the idea of generating destroyable cubes and bomb effect checking, so I turned to that part instead. I should focus more on communication next week.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Need to update the communication between graphics and clients. Add more game logic.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I learned how to run the code holistically on the demo machine. It’s important and I hope it’s not too late.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Great!

<br><br>
Complete the object manipulation workflow on the server.<br>
Design the protocol of the data transfer between server and client.
<br><br>

I completed all of the above.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Some of the features that I completed are not yet tested, so I am not sure if they will work as expected.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Complete the main game logic for player, bomb, and passive items.
<br><br>

I learned from others how to effectively work on projects using vscode.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Great!

			<h2 class="left-text">Week 8</h2>
			<div class="report-content">
				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
Complete the communication between client side and graphics.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
I completed it. Now that we’ve got the MVP for the game! :)
<br><br>

<br><br>
I’ve finished everything.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Add more game logic; testing.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I’ve learned how the matrix for graphics works. I didn’t expect to learn it so far, but it’s really helpful for me when implementing the code.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Great!
