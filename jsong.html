<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
My goal was to learn some OpenGL knowledge from past CSE167 lectures and assignments, as well as the official documentation of OpenGL.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
Not completely. I’ve downloaded OpenGL and I think that I’ve finished the setup, but there is still a lot I don’t understand about OpenGL. I haven’t understood their hw2 yet.
<br><br>
<b>3. If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. So answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</b>
<br><br>
Xincheng suddenly decided to go back to China last Thursday, and we packed together, which left barely any time for him to teach me OpenGL or for me to learn the materials by myself.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Continue the learning process. Hopefully I could render something with Emily and Xincheng next week.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I’ve learnt how to set up OpenGL, and some basics in OpenGL. I do expect to learn them.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Nice.
