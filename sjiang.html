                <p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
The goal of week 2 is to get familiar with the Blender and be able to build basic models.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
I learned a lot about Blender by watching youtube tutorials.<br>
I experienced Blender by building a donut model.
<br><br>
<b>3. If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. So answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</b>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
I will create a basic map for this game. Different geometry structures will be used to represent whether that block can be bombed out.<br>
Also, I will create the model for characters and bombs.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I have learned how to use Blender to create models.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
I am positive about our group working environment.

				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
The goal of week 3 is to design maps and figures models.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
I have designed a map with blocks that cannot be boomed.<br>
I covered the donut with icing so that it can be used in the map as blocks.<br>
I have compared several 3d models that can be used as characters.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
I will create some artistic models that can be used as blocks in the map.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I have learned some advanced skills about Blender in creating models.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
I am positive about our group working environment.

			<h2 class="left-text">Week 4</h2>
			<div class="report-content">
				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
Build suitable models for the character, bomb, weapons and obstacles.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
I have found a suitable character model with idle, walk, and damage animation. Also, I have found some objects that are suitable for obstacles.
<br><br>

<br><br>
The model of bomb and weapons are not built. This is due to the situation that we did not fully determine our weapon system in the previous team meeting. We have solved this problem in this week’s meeting and I will finish this part in week 5.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Finish modeling the objects.<br>
Get familiar with creating animation.<br>
Create the model of the figure with a specific weapon.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Good.
