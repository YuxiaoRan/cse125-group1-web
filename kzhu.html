<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
Get to know networking libraries. Settled on Asio.<br>
Get to know server client TCP communication. Think about the structure of the message.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
Settle on a library, Asio, and build all the messaging on it.
<br><br>
<b>3. If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. So answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</b>
<br><br>
I was surprised that g++ on Windows is surprisingly complicated, but thanks to existing tools like MinGW, it is much simpler.<br>
Also, the configuration of build tasks in VSCode took much longer than expected, including figuring out library issues and compiler parameters.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
I am aiming to complete networking and make all the communication structured. For example, I plan to package networking into one class, make sure clients send inputs to the server and server can correctly cache these inputs, and implement threading and locks for accessing cached inputs.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I learned how to use networking in games.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Good.

<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
I am aiming to complete networking and make all the communication structured. I packaged networking into one class, make sure clients send inputs to the server and server can correctly cache these inputs, implement threading and locks for accessing cached inputs, and server can correctly distinguish different clients.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
All of them.
<br><br>
<b>3. If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. So answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</b>
<br><br>
Goals are met.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Work on the server side more. Add the gaming logic and states to the server. Correctly process inputs from clients, update states, and send states back.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I learned the use of classes extensively and new concepts in C++ such as shared_ptr, lambda functions, super simple mutex, and different initialization syntax. I did not expect to learn them as either they were never used previously or used at a more lower level in C, which is more complicated.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Good.
