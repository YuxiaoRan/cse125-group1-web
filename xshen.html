<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
My goal was to do some reviews of OpenGL, and to teach Jamie some basics.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
I’ve almost finished the reviewing process, but haven’t taught Jamie much yet.
<br><br>
<b>3. If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. So answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</b>
<br><br>
I bought the flight ticket to China last Thursday, and Jamie and I spent a lot of time preparing for my departure.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Start rendering.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
Since I was doing the review, I didn’t learn anything new.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Great.

			<h2 class="left-text">Week 4</h2>
			<div class="report-content">
				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
My goal was to finish most of the graphics code on loading, displaying, transforming the models.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
Our graphics group finished our main goal.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Some of our code is from cse167. It would be nice if we can clean up the code more and maybe refactor the structure so that the code is more specialized for the game.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
I would like to clean up the graphics code. And in my spare time, I would like to help with the main game logic.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
This week by reading others’ code, I learned some of the mechanics of the server/client group’s work. I didn’t expect to learn that.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
I feel great; everyone in the team is more enthusiastic than ever to make the game work and make it fun to play.

				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
The goal was to 1. clean up the code for graphics 2. Study the appropriate animation mechanics for our game.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
I finished both goals.
<br><br>

<br><br>
I finished my goal. I think I may have some good points for some of the features that others are implementing, but I failed to convince some of them.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
I would like to finish up the graphics code, and start testing.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I learned about animation in opengl, which is expected.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
I feel fine.
