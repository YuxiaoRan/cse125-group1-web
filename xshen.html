<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
My goal was to do some reviews of OpenGL, and to teach Jamie some basics.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
I’ve almost finished the reviewing process, but haven’t taught Jamie much yet.
<br><br>
<b>3. If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. So answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</b>
<br><br>
I bought the flight ticket to China last Thursday, and Jamie and I spent a lot of time preparing for my departure.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Start rendering.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
Since I was doing the review, I didn’t learn anything new.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Great.

<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
My goal was to finish most of the graphics code on loading, displaying, transforming the models.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
Our graphics group finished our main goal.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Some of our code is from cse167. It would be nice if we can clean up the code more and maybe refactor the structure so that the code is more specialized for the game.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
I would like to clean up the graphics code. And in my spare time, I would like to help with the main game logic.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
This week by reading others’ code, I learned some of the mechanics of the server/client group’s work. I didn’t expect to learn that.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
I feel great; everyone in the team is more enthusiastic than ever to make the game work and make it fun to play.

			<div class="report-content">
				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
The goal was to 1. clean up the code for graphics 2. Study the appropriate animation mechanics for our game.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
I finished both goals.
<br><br>

<br><br>
I finished my goal. I think I may have some good points for some of the features that others are implementing, but I failed to convince some of them.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
I would like to finish up the graphics code, and start testing.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I learned about animation in opengl, which is expected.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
I feel fine.

			<h2 class="left-text">Week 6</h2>
			<div class="report-content">
				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
Displaying the new objects on the client. Try to fix the compiling problem so that now everyone is able to compile and run.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
Displayed some of the new objects on the client.<br>
Worked together to fix the compiling problem.
<br><br>

<br><br>
The .obj files are of different formats, which I didn’t expect. We were manually parsing all the .obj files of only one specific format. I am thinking of either using some python script to convert all .obj files into the same format, or we can find some package that handles reading .obj files for us.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Fix the .obj file reading problem: hopefully all objects should be able to display once we finish this.<br>
Map proper texture to the objects.<br>
Merge the graphics branch.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I reviewed some git knowledge and some compiling knowledge like linking.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
I am a little neverse about our progress, but overall I feel good.

			<div class="report-content">
				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
Fix the .obj file reading problem: hopefully all objects should be able to display once we finish this.<br>
Map proper texture to the objects.<br>
Merge the graphics branch.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
Introduced assimp so that complex obj files can be properly read (mostly).<br>
Implemented the feature that allows objects to fallback to use colored cubes/spheres when the models from the obj file fail to read.<br>
Rewrote shader so that the shader works for objects of different formats.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Failed to merge the graphics branch and the main branch: there seemed to be some bugs in the main branch at the time I tried to merge them.<br>
There’s still something with the assimp that needs to be figured out. Some of the materials are yet read properly, including some of the texture. I am not sure if this is the problem of some of the models that we found from the internet though.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Let’s make the game playable!
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I had a deeper understanding of graphics and learned more about assimp.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
I felt really frustrated with the assimp. It took our graphics team quite some time to get assimp work, but I am glad it finally worked to some degree.

<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
We finally made the MVP, and the game is playable.

<br><br>
Not quite. I’m satisfied with our progress last week.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
Fine tune the parameters of the models so that they look better in the game.<br>
Make actions in the game look more natural.<br>
More visual effects hopefully.<br>
Sound effect hopefully.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
There were always things unexpected, I had a better understanding on the agile software development.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
Relaxed but also nervous.
