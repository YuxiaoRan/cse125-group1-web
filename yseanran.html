<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
My goal for Week 2 was to get familiar with the Winsock protocol. By reading online tutorials and documentations, I was hoping to develop a simple Winsock client/server application, so that I would be able to connect to the socket, and send/receive data on the Client.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
With the help of Microsoft's tutorial, I was able to implement a Winsock client application, connect to the socket, and send/receive data on the Client. I'm still learning the remaining steps to create a Winsock server application.
<br><br>
<b>3. If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. So answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</b>
<br><br>
I would say that I failed to develop a complete Winsock server-client application because of limited time and resources, and lack of interaction with Kaihan. I also need to figure out how the overall architecture of our game and how everything is connected together.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
For Week 3, my goal is to develop a complete Winsock client/server application, and implement necessary interaction between the Client and the Server. Also, I want to work with Kaihan, who is working on networks as well, and talk about how we can apply our network application to the game. If possible, I also want to discuss the game logic with my team and start writing backend gameplay code.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I got a chance to revisit Visual Studio and C++ coding, and pick up the basic C++ syntax and server/client side knowledge.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
There are still a lot of skills to learn to do my assigned tasks. Networking has been my weakness and I do think that it would be difficult to work on this alone throughout the entire quarter, so I hope to interact more with my teammates and learn from them. I'm confident about our gameplay development.
