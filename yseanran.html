<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
My goal for Week 2 was to get familiar with the Winsock protocol. By reading online tutorials and documentations, I was hoping to develop a simple Winsock client/server application, so that I would be able to connect to the socket, and send/receive data on the Client.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
With the help of Microsoft's tutorial, I was able to implement a Winsock client application, connect to the socket, and send/receive data on the Client. I'm still learning the remaining steps to create a Winsock server application.
<br><br>
<b>3. If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. So answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</b>
<br><br>
I would say that I failed to develop a complete Winsock server-client application because of limited time and resources, and lack of interaction with Kaihan. I also need to figure out how the overall architecture of our game and how everything is connected together.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
For Week 3, my goal is to develop a complete Winsock client/server application, and implement necessary interaction between the Client and the Server. Also, I want to work with Kaihan, who is working on networks as well, and talk about how we can apply our network application to the game. If possible, I also want to discuss the game logic with my team and start writing backend gameplay code.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I got a chance to revisit Visual Studio and C++ coding, and pick up the basic C++ syntax and server/client side knowledge.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
There are still a lot of skills to learn to do my assigned tasks. Networking has been my weakness and I do think that it would be difficult to work on this alone throughout the entire quarter, so I hope to interact more with my teammates and learn from them. I'm confident about our gameplay development.

				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
My goals for this week were to work with Kaihan, decide which network library to use, and implement a client-server application.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
I developed a simple network application using Winsock. After comparing my application with the Boost library, and how they will be compatible with our coding environment and compiled on our machines, I decided to follow Kaihan's plan and learned the Boost library instead. Also, I was able to design some server-side interfaces for future gameplay development.

<br><br>
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
I will continue to work with Kaihan, Jamie, and the graphics team, to finish our interface designs, and start to implement these interfaces with actual gameplay logic and model rendering.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
I learned about the usage of the Boost library in game development, design of the overall game workflow and architecture, and interface design skills.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
I feel we are a bit delayed at the current stage. I'm concerned about how to integrate everything together, and how to deliver a minimal viable product as soon as possible.

			<div class="report-content">
				<p>
<b>1. What were your concrete goals for the week?</b>
<br><br>
My goals for the week were to finish our interface designs, and start to implement these interfaces with actual gameplay logic and model rendering.
<br><br>
<b>2. What goals were you able to accomplish?</b>
<br><br>
I was able to finish the class design for game objects, and related interface methods that can be used by client/server for communication.
<br><br>
<b>3. If there were goals you were unable to meet, what were the reasons? note that this happens regularly…I would prefer you to be aggressive in what you want to try accomplish rather than limit yourself to goals you know you’ll easily achieve. So answering this question is more of a reflection on the development process and the surprises you encounter, it’s not at all an evaluation.</b>
<br><br>
I wasn't able to finish the actual implementation of those interface methods. Instead, Kaihan was taking a leading role during the last week to integrate the graphics side and the client side.
<br><br>
<b>4. What are your specific goals for the next week?</b>
<br><br>
My goals for the next week are to render more models with our existing networking code, and to implement more actual game logic based on our current interface design.
<br><br>
<b>5. What did you learn this week, if anything (and did you expect to learn it?)</b>
<br><br>
The past week was more about design and implementation rather than learning new skills.
<br><br>
<b>6. What is your individual morale (which might be different from the overall group morale)?</b>
<br><br>
With the great work by Kaihan, we start to see a simple version of our game with controllable objects rendered on the screen, so I'm confident with our future work. I think I need to take more responsibility and be more active to help other team members.
